# My Cyber Blog- Muhammad Subhan Nizal's made on 17/07/2025

**A fully automated, AI-powered cybersecurity portfolio blogâ€”documenting daily technical activity, project work, and professional growth with zero manual effort.**

## ðŸ›  Project Overview

This project integrates your real cyber work into a living, public blog and portfolio site using:

- **ActivityWatch:** Records daily applications and activities on your PC.
- **Python Automation:** Parses logs, classifies cybersecurity activity, and summarizes key projects.
- **Ollama (Local LLM):** Generates professional, reflective blog posts using AI based on your tracked logs and project highlights.
- **MkDocs:** Converts generated content into a static website.
- **GitHub Pages:** Hosts and publishes the portfolio for public access.
- **Windows Task Scheduler:** Ensures daily, hands-off updates and deployments.

---

## ðŸš¦ How It Works

1. **Activity Tracking**  
   ActivityWatch collects all window and application usage logs on your machine.

2. **Data Processing**  
   Python scripts:
   - Export and classify the dayâ€™s cybersecurity activities.
   - Read project highlights from a dedicated file (`projects.json`).
   - Combine these into a detailed prompt for AI.

3. **AI Blog Writing**  
   A local LLM (via Ollama) generates a professional Markdown blog post summarizing both your daily activity and major project achievements.

4. **Website Generation & Deployment**  
   - The new post is added to the blog.
   - MkDocs builds the static site.
   - GitHub Pages deploys it publicly at  
     **https://subhan1414.github.io/my-cyber-blog/**

5. **Full Automation**  
   Task Scheduler runs the entire workflow daily, requiring no manual intervention.
